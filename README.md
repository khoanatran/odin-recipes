This is a beginner-friendly project to create a website with HTML as part of the Odin Project curriculum.
I look forward to share my favorite recipes to everyone :)

The project helps me accomplish several things:
- Create a basic website with linked webpages using HTML boilerplate.
- Create basic webpages with images, unordered list, and ordered list using HTML.
- Reinforce Git workflow and operate with Linux command line to stage and commit repositories to Github.
- Meaningfully share my favorite daily cooking routine with healthy, balanced, planted-based recipes.
- Leave a touch of Vietnamese to the Odin Project community with recipes that I grew up with :)
